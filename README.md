- âš¡ Fun fact: The perihelion precession of Mercury was mystery for a long time for scientists, which was solved by Einsteins explanation of General Relativity. This implies a deviation from Newton's 1/r gravitational potential, which results in a non-conservation of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector, whose conservation can be explained by an SO(4) symmetry of the 1/r potential in the classical Kepler problem :)
